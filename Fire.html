			<h3>When to build a fire</h3>
			<p>Fire provides light, warmth, morale, a method to cook food, and defense against wild animals. In general, shelter is often prioritized first and fire second; however, it is imperative to build a fire as soon as possible when 
				hypothermia is a risk. While constructing a suitable fire may seem like an easy task, it is often extremely difficult because of weather, lack of modern tools, or inability to properly prepare burning materials.
			</p>
			<h3>Gathering supplies</h3>
			<p>To construct a fire, you need 3 kinds of fuel - Tinder, Kindling, and Squaw wood. Tinder refers to fibrous materials that will catch a spark or flame easily. Those who are prepared may have cotton, long burning fire starters, or paper; however, 
			if these materials become wet or one may not have anticipated the need for fire. Tinder can be acquired from dry pine needles, leaves, spider-webs, birch bark, or any other kind of fibrous dry plant material. Because these materials need to light on fire easily,
			it's essential to ensure they remain dry. Gather as much kindling as possible so that your flame does not die out if there is a gust of wind or sudden precipitation.
			Kindling consists of small twigs and sticks no larger than your pinky finger. Kindling is used to catch the flame produced
			by lighting tinder, and sustaining the flame long enough to add larger fuel. Lastly, "squaw" wood refers to larger tree limbs larger than kindling. Squaw wood is ultimately the fuel that you would like to burn since it is long lasting and hot.
			If it is raining or snowing, look for dry materials that are sheltered from the elements by overhangs or fallen trees. 
			</p>

			<h3>Preparing a fire pit</h3>
			<p>Preparing the fuel and a fire pit before attempting to start a fire will ensure that your fuel has the highest likelihood of burning efficiently. First begin by digging out a hole in the ground to place your fire in.
			If the ground is wet, place bark, clothes, or any other materials between where the fire will be lit and the earth below. Carefully place your tinder pile in the center of the dry pit and put your kindling around and on top of the tinder. Leave a space so you can access
			the tinder pile when you are ready to light it. There are several ways to place the kindling, the most common method being a miniature teepee. This design allows the flames from the burning tinder to catch the kindling above it. After you are certain your kindling will not blow out, carefully
			add the squaw wood and build the fire until it reaches the desired size.
			</p>
			<p>
			You can improve your fire pit by creating a "fire wall" behind the fire pit facing your shelter (or where you intend to build a shelter). A fire wall is simply a stack of very large wood, such as fallen tree trunks. This improvement can be used to dry out wet wood and more importantly,
			it will reflect heat back towards your shelter that would have otherwise dissipated. Fire walls are very beneficial in cold environments.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Lighting a fire without matches</h3>
			<p>Creating a fire without matches or a lighter may seem like a daunting task but wilderness survival is all about creativity. Learn to recognize tools that can help you in situations such as these. A few examples of ways to create fire are listed below</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Strike flint and steel together. Quartz (a common rock) can sometimes produce a spark when smashed together or against metal.</li>
			<li>Those who are far-sighted can use their glasses to concentrate the suns rays on a single point to light a fire. Alternatively, a magnifying glass works well. </li>
			<li>Similar to the above, filling a clear plastic bag with water can concentrate sunlight at a single point</li>
			<li>Polish an aluminum can to reflect light on a single point</li>
			<li>A 9-volt battery can be touched to steel wool to light the steel wool on fire</li>
			<li>A friction method such as the bow drill which involves quickly rubbing soft wood (such as cedar) together to produce heat</li>
			</ul>
