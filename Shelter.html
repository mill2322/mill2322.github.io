			<h3>Why is shelter important?</h3>
			<p> In most survival situations, your first priority is to construct a robust shelter. Prolonged exposure to severe weather conditions can ultimately result in death, so it is important to understand the necessity of cover and basic rules of construction in order to increase your odds of survival. A shelter will not only provide a safe haven from natural dangers, but it will restore your morale, enthusiasm, and will to live. </p>

			<h3>Choosing a location</h3>
			<p>A survival shelter is only as sturdy as the location it is built upon. 
				Ask yourself the following questions before starting construction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If it rains, will I be sleeping in water? 
				If you set up camp too close to water (creeks, lakes, rivers, etc) your shelter is at risk of flooding. 
				<li>Can any rocks, dead tree branches, or otherwise squish me in the night? 
				During high winds, weak tree limbs and heavy debris overhead can fall and potentially destroy your base. 
				<li> What types of insects and predators have I seen in the area? 
				This will help determine whether or not you should build your shelter off the ground to protect yourself from critters and bugs that may try to share your fort with you. 
			</ul>
			<h3>Constructing a shelter</h3>
			<p>	After finding the optimal location for your temporary home, you might find yourself lost in the daunting task of construction. Luckily, the great outdoors offers a number of natural foundations to assist you in your build. A home can be found in places like rock formations, trees, and caves. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One basic but handy shelter for your survival knowledge repertoire, is referred to as a lean-to. 
				Using what you have at hand (trash bags, tarp, foliage, etc) and what the environment around you can provide (trees, logs, sticks) you can forge a shelter that will stand for an ample amount of time to carry out other survival tasks. 
				When building your lean-to, simply fasten a fallen branch to a standing tree to establish the skeleton of your shelter. This can be done using twine or thin, flexible branches. Then, drape your tarp over the branch to create a wall. If you do not have any fabric-like material at hand, you can prop smaller branches up against your “skeleton” to form the wall and then pack dirt and leaves into any gaps to insulate your fort. (In colder climates you might consider combining both techniques to double-insulate your fort.) 
			</p>
				After you’ve mastered the lean-to, you can expand your collection of shelter-go-to’s with a few more basic models. 
				The first being, a Y-stick shelter. This type of cover works best in a similar environment in which you would apply a lean-to. Using two thick branches that fork at the end, cut down the length to where it stands about waist-height. Trim the two forked branches to where they can hold a support a “cross-bar” branch. To complete the shelter, follow the steps of creating a wall for a lean-to fort. 
			<p>
				Lean-to’s and Y-stick Shelters are great for forested areas, but what if you find yourself in an emergency situation in a different sort of environment? Fortunately, there is a shelter suitable for every climate and stretch of the Earth, it’s just a matter of planning and research. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if you find yourself in stranded in a desolate tundra, you can build a Quinzhee hut. The title might sound like an advanced shelter, but a Quinzhee hut is the simplest snow fort to construct. Start by shoveling a mountain of snow large enough for you to lay inside. Shape and pack the snow into a large dome, and allow it some time to harden up. Hollow out the inside, and you have yourself a winter-scape bungalow.
