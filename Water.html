		<h3>Collecting clean drinking water</h3>
		<p>Clean fresh water is the next priority once a shelter and fire have been constructed; Humans are expected to live around 72 hours without water.
		Fresh water should be obtained from flowing water as stagnant water is often a breeding ground for parasites and is unsafe to drink. It is still recommended that you purify water before drinking it.
		If you are in an area where large bodies of water are not common there are several methods of finding drinking water: 
		</p>
		<ul>
				<li>Listen for insects (such as crickets) at night time, especially if in a desert. Often times insects are near a source of fresh water.</li>
				<li>Look for green vegetation as these plants must have a water source to grow. You can even wrap a plastic bag around a branch with green leaves to collect condensation from moisture evaporating from the leaves. </li>
				<li>If it is cloudy or rainy, prepare a container to collect rain water.</li>
				<li>WHEN PROPERLY DISTILLED, urine can be converted into drinking water. This process is described below. </li>
		</ul>	
		<h3>Purifying water</h3>
		<p>There are many ways to purify water in the modern age. If you are going camping, its recommended that you buy a water purifier that will save you the trouble of removing contaminents. Similarly, water purification tablets
		can be dissolved in water to clean it. Another method uses UV light to kill bacteria. If you choose to use either of these methods, be sure to filter out large objects. This could be done by hand or the water can be run through a cloth (such as a shirt). </p>
		<p>If you do not have any modern tools, thats okay! The fire you constructed can be used to boil water which kills patheogens that may live in it. It may be difficult to find a container that can withstand heat. Tin cans or pottery can be used as containers in a pinch.
		Another way to boil water is by placing a burning ember on a chunk of wood roughly the size of your head. The ember will slowly burn the wood producing a smooth pit without burning all of the wood. Place a few dry rocks in your fire and scoop them out when they are very hot, then fill the container with water and place the hot rocks inside to heat up the water</p>
		<p>The British SAS handbook suggests a method called distillation which produces 100% pure water. In this method, one tries to evaporate contaminated water and collect the condensation which is drinkable! Dig a ditch and fill with contaminated water or urine. In the center of the ditch, place a container that is taller than the water line. Cover the whole ditch with a clear plastic bag and put a rock over the container so the 
		plastic bag droops at that point. In doing so, the evaporated urine or water will condensate on the plastic, then run down to the point where the rock causes the plastic to sag. Finally it will drip into your container!</p>
